### qrl-qai: The quantum analogue of OpenAI's gym python framework 
 

---

**qrl-qai** is a python framework built on top of **Gymnasium**, **PennyLane**, and **PyTorch** to serve as a central platform for everything **quantum reinforcement learning**.

The current release (0.3.0) offers 5 native quantum RL style environments:

* **BlochSphereV0**
* **CompilerV0**
* **ErrorChannelV0**
* **ExpressibilityV0**
* **ProbabilityV0**

Check out the [Quickstart](https://qrl-qai.readthedocs.io/en/v0.3.0/getting_started/quickstart.html) guide to get started.

Additionally, each significant release has an asssociated Google Colab and Lightning AI Studio for a hassle free experience. These are especially useful for users who want to quickly test out the environments without going through the installation process.

Lightnining AI Studio contains a Streamlit playground for no-code experimentation with the environments!

## 🗺 Roadmap
![QRL Roadmap](qrl_roadmap.png)  

---

## 🚀 Installation

Install the package directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install qrl-qai
```
To save the episodes as `mp4` videos, it is essential to have `ffmpeg` installed on your system. In the absence of ffmpeg, you can run the environments but save the episodes as `gif` only and not `mp4`. 

To check if you have ffmpeg installed (Windows/Linux/Mac), you can try:

```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

To install ffmpeg, you can follow these steps:

### Using Conda

You can also install FFmpeg within a conda environment:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
```

### Windows

Option 1: Using Chocolatey (Recommended)

If you have Chocolatey installed:

```bash
choco install ffmpeg
```

✅ Option 2: Manual installation

1. Go to the [official FFmpeg site](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) → Click Windows → gyan.dev builds or BtbN builds.

2. Download the latest release full build ZIP.

3. Extract it (e.g., to C:\ffmpeg).

4. Add the bin folder to your PATH:

   4.1 Press Win + R → sysdm.cpl → Advanced → Environment Variables

   4.2 Edit Path → Add new entry: C:\ffmpeg\bin

### Linux

Debian / Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg -y
```

Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install ffmpeg -y
```

Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
```

### macOS

Using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```
