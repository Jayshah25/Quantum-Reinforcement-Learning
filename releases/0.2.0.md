ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s New

1. Refined ErrorChannelV0 Environment

    * Simplified to use only the BitFlip error channel, controlled by a user-defined probability.

    * Removed PhaseFlip and AmplitudeDamping noise options for a more focused experimental setup.

    * The action space is now restricted to applying an X gate while the reward is changed to `-MeanSquaredError(|00..0>,|Corrected State>)`

2. Rendering Improvements

    * Fixed multiple rendering bugs across all environments for smoother visualization and reliable playback.

    * Improved compatibility with animation tools and FFmpeg rendering.

3. Enhanced Reliability with Tests

    * Added comprehensive pytest test suite to the GitHub repository.

    * Ensures environment consistency and helps prevent regressions in future releases.
