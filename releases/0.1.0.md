# ðŸš€ qrl-qai v0.1.0  (First Release)

Weâ€™re excited to announce the first release of qrl-qai. It is an attempt to create a quantum analogue of OpenAI's gym library. Its focus is on novel quantum computing RL environments and classical and quantum RL algorithms. 

# âœ¨ Whatâ€™s Included

This release introduces five quantum control & learning environments compatible with RL workflows:

**BlochSphereV0** â€“ Learn and visualize single-qubit rotations on the Bloch sphere.

**CompilerV0** â€“ Train agents to optimize quantum circuit compilation.

**ErrorChannelV0** â€“ Explore RL-based strategies under noisy quantum channels.

**ExpressibilityV0** â€“ Benchmark and optimize parameterized quantum circuits for expressibility.

**ProbabilityV0** â€“ Reinforcement learning over probability distributions from quantum measurements.

# ðŸ“¦ Highlights

* Follows the gym style architecture for environments.

* Visualization tools for each novel quantum computing RL envrionment.

# ðŸ”® Whatâ€™s Next

Future releases will expand the library with:

Quantum versions of classic control environments (CartPole, MountainCar, etc.).

Wrappers like BattleWrapper for agent-vs-agent setups with quantum vs classical side-by-side visualization.
